I am a second year biochem major who hopes to one day become a forensic analyst. I have job experiences that ranges from protein isolation and production to folding clothes into neat little piles. In my free time you will usually see me playing soccer with my friends or at the gym, but more often than not I will be relaxing at home either playing video games such as pokemon or minecraft or curling up with a good book my sister recommends me, both of these hobbies usually enjoyed with my adorable dog and/or bunny.
